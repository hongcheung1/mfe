Build incredibly scalable apps with a microfrontend architecture

# Description

Microfrontends are used to divide a large app into a series of smaller apps. This provides a set of unique benefits to any frontend:

Author smaller, easier to understand codebases

Use a different set of libraries for each sub-app - bring the best tool for the job!

Deploy each portion separately - limit the chance of interrupting your users

Allow each of your engineering teams to work independently

Learn design patterns used by the largest companies in the world

Understand when to use microfrontends

Link multiple apps together using a tiered routing system

Scope CSS on your page to prevent cross-app contamination

Avoid sharing state between apps to promote isolation

Deploy each portion of your app independently to avoid production bugs

Scaffold a CI/CD pipeline to automate your release process

Utilize multiple front-end frameworks in the same app

Maximize performance by using module federation

I built this boilerplate for self study. I've put years of my own experience.
