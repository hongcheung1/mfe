Build incredibly scalable apps with a microfrontend architecture

# Description

Congratulations! You've found the most popular, most complete, and most up-to-date resource online for learning how to use microfrontends!

Thousands of other engineers have learned microfrontends, and you can too. This course uses a time-tested, battle-proven method to make sure you understand exactly how microfrontends work, and will get you a new job working as a software engineer or help you build that app you've always been dreaming about.

The difference between this course and all the others: you will understand the design patterns used by top companies to build massively popular web apps.

Microfrontends are used to divide a large app into a series of smaller apps. This provides a set of unique benefits to any frontend:

Author smaller, easier to understand codebases

Use a different set of libraries for each sub-app - bring the best tool for the job!

Deploy each portion separately - limit the chance of interrupting your users

Allow each of your engineering teams to work independently

This new architecture is popular, but there is a lot of misinformation online. This course has been developed with input from top engineers to ensure total technical accuracy. Additionally, you'll learn how to evaluate whether microservices are a good choice for your application.
